# DedSec-BR
DedSec BR is a program made on batch which picks up the best hacking tools (Password Hash Tools, DDOS tools and more) for Windows and brings it all together.
[IMP8RT4NT! R3AD TH1S!]
The Program does not include metasploit-framework or any exploiting tool, why? Exploiting Tools don't have a good relationship with Windows in general, Here's the reasons:
1. Some Programs in it's full versions are paid.
2. Antivirus Softwares slay them.
3. If i put exploiting tools on my program, alot of people would use the tools in a bad way, and i'm 12, not 24, i will not solve any problem that includes people messing around with stuff like penetrating private systems.
